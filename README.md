# JPACRUDProject

## Overview

The JPACRUDProject is an app that displays public showers from a database.
Users can create, update, and delete items from the database using the app interface.

### How to Run

Users select an option from the homepage. 
The user can view shower locations based upon ID, add a shower to the database, or delete a shower from the database. 
The user can return to the homescreen at anytime and confirm changes via ID search. 
The ID number auto-increments as showers are added to the database.
